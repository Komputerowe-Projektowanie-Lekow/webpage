        <h1>Protein Folding, Rendered In ASCII</h1>
        <p>
          An experimental rendering pipeline transforms volumetric protein motion into a living ASCII mosaic.
          Every glyph is a pixel pulled straight from the source frames - no shaders, just characters and time.
        </p>

        <p>
          From raw video to glyph-perfect animation: the pipeline samples each frame in Python,
          maps luminance to a bespoke character palette, and streams it on the page via a lightweight
          decoder that adapts resolution to your screen in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is a motion backdrop slim enough for GitHub Pages, yet rich enough to highlight
          volumetric motion and subtle folding cues without distracting overlays.

        <p>
          Drop in a new clip, regenerate frames with <code>build_ascii.py</code>, and ship to GitHub Pages instantly. Everything here is static and portable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remix the palette, adjust the cadence, or swap the source clip entirely - the renderer adapts
          automatically. Everything stays static, portable, and open for experimentation.
