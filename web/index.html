        <h1>Protein Folding, Rendered In ASCII</h1>
        <p>
          An experimental rendering pipeline transforms volumetric protein motion into a living ASCII mosaic.
          Every glyph is a pixel pulled straight from the source frames - no shaders, just characters and time.

        <h1>The Rendering Pipeline</h1>
        <p>
          Our experimental ASCII rendering pipeline transforms volumetric protein motion data into
          a living character mosaic. The process bridges computational biology and web visualization,
          creating an accessible way to observe molecular dynamics without requiring specialized software.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Core Components</h2>
        <p>
          The rendering system consists of three main stages that work together to produce
          real-time ASCII animations from molecular simulation data:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frame Extraction:</strong> Raw simulation data is processed frame by frame,
          with each molecular configuration captured at precise time intervals</li>
          <li><strong>Luminance Mapping:</strong> 3D structures are projected onto a 2D plane,
          with depth and density information converted to grayscale intensity values</li>
          <li><strong>Character Assignment:</strong> A custom palette of ASCII characters replaces
          pixel intensity values, creating the distinctive text-based visualization</li>
          <li><strong>Resolution Adaptation:</strong> The decoder dynamically adjusts character
          density based on viewport size, ensuring optimal rendering on any screen</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Frame preloading and caching strategies
          maintain smooth playback even on lower-powered devices</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The pipeline is implemented using Python for data processing and vanilla JavaScript
          for client-side rendering. This approach ensures maximum compatibility while maintaining
          performance:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Python scripts handle molecular data extraction and frame generation</li>
          <li>Canvas API enables efficient pixel-to-character conversion in the browser</li>
          <li>Web Workers manage frame preloading without blocking the main thread</li>
          <li>CSS transforms and GPU acceleration smooth out animation playback</li>
          <li>Progressive enhancement ensures graceful degradation on older browsers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          The entire system is designed to be portable and self-contained. Once processed,
          the ASCII frames can be hosted on any static file server, making the visualization
          accessible without requiring backend infrastructure or specialized hosting.

        <h1>Applications & Use Cases</h1>
        <p>
          This ASCII rendering approach opens up new possibilities for visualizing complex molecular
          data in accessible, lightweight formats. The technique is particularly useful for educational
          content, research presentations, and interactive demonstrations where traditional 3D rendering
          may be impractical or unnecessary.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Educational Applications</h2>
        <p>
          ASCII-based protein visualization provides several advantages for teaching molecular biology
          and biochemistry:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Works on any device without requiring specialized software or plugins</li>
          <li>Loads quickly even on slow connections, improving accessibility</li>
          <li>Text-based format is inherently accessible to screen readers</li>
          <li>Can be embedded in documentation, wikis, and educational materials</li>
          <li>Reduces cognitive load by focusing on motion and overall structure</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Research Communication</h2>
        <p>
          For researchers presenting molecular dynamics simulations, ASCII rendering offers
          unique benefits:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Lightweight animations suitable for supplementary materials</li>
          <li>Version control friendly - frames stored as simple text files</li>
          <li>Easy to integrate into static site generators and documentation</li>
          <li>Reproducible rendering from raw simulation data</li>
          <li>Platform-independent playback without proprietary software</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Customization Options</h2>
        <p>
          The rendering pipeline is designed to be highly configurable. You can adapt it
          for your specific needs:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Character Palette:</strong> Adjust the ASCII character set to control
          density and visual style</li>
          <li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Balance smoothness against file size by modifying
          the sampling interval</li>
          <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Configure target character dimensions for different
          screen sizes</li>
          <li><strong>Color Schemes:</strong> Apply color coding to highlight specific molecular
          features or regions</li>
          <li><strong>Playback Speed:</strong> Control animation tempo to emphasize particular
          conformational changes</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
          To process your own molecular dynamics trajectory, simply run <code>build_ascii.py</code>
          with your simulation files. The script handles frame extraction, projection, and
          character mapping automatically. Output files are ready to deploy to any static
          hosting service, including GitHub Pages, Netlify, or traditional web servers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The entire system is open source and designed for experimentation. Fork the repository,
          modify the rendering parameters, and create visualizations tailored to your specific
          research or educational needs.
